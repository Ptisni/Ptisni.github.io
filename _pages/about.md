Hi, and welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Peter, and I am currently a PhD student in AI and Robotics at King's College London, advised by [Dr Matteo Leonetti](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/matteo-leonetti) and [Dr Gerard Canal](https://gerardcanal.github.io/). My research is situated at the intersection of Robot Learning, Planning, and Human--Robot Interaction. I am designing algorithms with which the robots are able to learn their collaborator's capabilities autonomously, and are then able to reason over these observations when deciding what actions to take in a shared task.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Human and Biological Robotics from Imperial College London, where I worked on adaptive footstep planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion as part of the [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Brunel University London.

This page is a work in progress, but this section is complete. Furthermore, you are free to check links to my Github, Scholar, LinkedIn, and email.

Hi, and welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Peter, and I am currently a PhD student in AI and Robotics at King's College London, advised by [Dr Matteo Leonetti](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/matteo-leonetti) and [Dr Gerard Canal](https://gerardcanal.github.io/). I am interested in developing autonomous (embodied) agents that are capable of collaborating with diverse partners across multiple tasks. I study approaches to inference of collaborator's capabilities, and mechanisms of adaptation based on reasoning about the information they acquire from observing what actions their partners perform in the shared task. I am also interested in enhancing robots' understanding of human psychophysiological state based on multi-modal human data (e.g., eye gaze, sound, and posture), on order for the robot to use this information to adapt its behaviour and improve interaction quality.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Human and Biological Robotics from Imperial College London, where I worked on adaptive footstep planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion as part of the [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Brunel University London.
